Space-Invaders-C-OpenGL
=======================

Remake of classic Space Invaders with some modifications. The objects (player, enemies and shots) are represented by a collection of small cubes (like Minecraft). This help to the logic part understand the graphic part, like collision, scales and movements. The code was implemented in C language using OpenGL (GLUT/GLU) for graphics part.
